This system is far from being plug-and-play but it does work once it is set up

You will need to create a file called 'shep_config.php' with the following contents:

<?

define('DB_HOST', 'your_mysql_host');
define('DB_USER' , 'your_user');
define('DB_PWD', 'your-password');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'scraper'); //just a suggestion for the name
define('EMAIL', 'your email address');
define('NAME', 'Your Firstname Lastname');

?>

see the included scraper.sql file for the db schema

You will also want to create an email to send out if you want to use the automated emailing feature. Just write up a nice template and save it as craigslist_email.html and the system will read the contents and send it to any of the listings you've selected. 

NOTE!! Craigslist is very very strict about emails. Unless you have a proper reverse DNS record for your server, they will not accept these emails. You need to either set up a proper reverse DNS record for the server you are using, or just send the emails one at a time the old fashioned way.
